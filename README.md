# GhidraCL

An experiment about trying to use Common Lisp with
[Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org). Initial goal was to be able to do Ghidra
scripting from comfort of [Emacs/Sly](https://github.com/joaotavora/sly). Maybe
I will later develop it into a full framework of loading CL scripts onto Ghidra.

My notes on how I went about implementing this can be found in my [notes
repo](https://github.com/asutoshpalai/notes/blob/master/Ghidra.md#plugin-development).
